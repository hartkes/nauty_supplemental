Command line parameters for plantri_maxdeg_poly:

./plantri_md_poly -D6 -H4 -f4 -c3 -m3 -p -g 17

-D: The -D switch gives a maximum degree for the 3-connected triangulations that are generated in phase 1.
-H: Then -H switch gives a maximum degree for the polytopes that are generated by removing edges from the triangulation.
-f: upper bound on maximum face size
-c: lower bound on the vertex connectivity.  Default 3.
-m: lower bound on the minimum degree.  Default 3.
-p: polytopes, ie, general simple plane graphs where the faces can be larger than triangles
-g: generate graph6 output
n: number of vertices
